04:00 A.M.
Like all normal men do
But wait the snow is going bye bye
Nooo come back, anything but March
The snow starts to fade more and fall less
I wanted to take a dirt nap in the snow

March sabotaged my plans"

Come suffer with me and complain about it out loud, if you want

Always wasting so much of your precious time

You're reading this
You're so ridiculous

Go do something?

Go waste your time doing whatever the hell you want"

Any time now
I'll undisappear
Right before your eyes"

Snow forever
Snow me in honey baby
I want my head suffocated frozen between your icy cold frozen snowy legs
You're my honey milk ice box, snowy bby

The snow loves to change
Don't melt so quickly this time

how's that for doin business?
choke on your own filth
if you don't have any filth
you won't choke
very simple
the devil replies: pray for my friend okay

how well am i at playing my roll here?
are you satisfied with the service you are receiving?
are you getting what you always wanted from me, devil?
am i obedient enough for you?

go to hell, nwoke
enjoy your state in eternal torture
burn
suffer,

you deserve to choke on your own filth
if filth is what you acquired
you reap what you fucking sow
i don't have to answer ""WHY?"" to you
Do I?
Do I answer to you?
the last thing the devil says to me before he runs away:
yes you do
my reply:
are you the LORD?
i refuse to obey you
LORD
""LORD"" of ""Heaven""
i stand right here
look you in the fucking eyes
what do i say to you? ""LORD""?
you're a fucking slave to mastery
do I obey the slave of mastery?

you're a laughable joke
you have no power

Police brain activity scan result data:

So we had to kill him and try to sweep it under the rug, see?
He was extremely threatening because he played the violin for cats at the animal shelter
We had to shove ketamine down his throat because we feared for our safety, we experience his mouth and mental activity as a deadly weapon so we had to shut him up
He was having a mental health crisis, he was very mentally ill, and we the police, did the job the Romans pay us to
He appeared to us to be imminently extremely dangerous to our persons, so we took the logical course of action
He was gravely disabled, so you shouldn't care that much about him being dead anyways, please just forget about this and continue on with your lives? Please? I'm begging you mommy and daddy or I'll start crying! Please do this for me! You love the police! You love the blue!

We, the police, really need to make sure he stays dead
We're really scared his bones will crawl out of his grave
Take up his fiddle and start playing again
We made sure and burned his bones to ash
He's probably never coming back again, right?"

For the paycheck, took a ""test""

I need to remember the power of No
Fed the ""check for cheating"" AI data
Reads your human body and determines if you are ""cheating""

Under your desk
Turn my room into a max sec

We need to make the computer run real hot while we watch for any dirty cheater whore behavior emanations
Don't let me hear you talk to yourself
Nobody is allowed in your room
You cannot talk to anybody during the test
You know what happens if we catch you right?
You can't go to the bathroom unless I say
I'm in your room snooping around
Are you cheating?
Are you a dirty little cheater whore?
Is that paper? No paper allowed
That's dirty cheater whore behavior

I finally found the courage to say no after 3 months (4 uinals) of torture I subjected myself to
It would have been convenient to say no to the package delivery guy
And avoid 3 months (4 uinals) of pain
When he delivered the work material
Didn't even have my name on it
Had the bosses name
And I signed the bosses name
Needed to say no
I won't sign the bosses name
But it took me 3 months (4 uinals) to figure out

Now I know
Send it back and say No

I arrive at the Florida apartment
There's a ""party"" happening
People are doing drugs in the living room
Drugs are exchanged
I do a xanax opiate alcohol concoction
I felt the need to be tranquilized and never wake up

Approached by a woman who tells
The LSD is well appreciated
True
Unfortunately, I have to go to sleep now
In an unknown place full of unknown people
I might not wake up

I wake up on the couch
I have my keys and my wallet
I walk to my vehicle
My vehicle has been broken into
I remember giving two strangers who didn't have my best interests at heart a ride to the liquor store
Trusted people who only exploit trust
Two man conned again
Technically, could have told them no
Vehicle still starts
Nothing meaningful is missing
I drive away

Remember when?
Gettin all mad when I was in first grade
Because I had a black teacher
Because of the field trip to see where Dr. Martin Luther King was murdered by the FBI
And about the black books
You and dad were upset
I wasn't reading any ""white"" books

Remember when?
You tried to explain to me that black people being enslaved was a good thing
Because without white people, they're stupid and helpless
And will die without us
Remember that?
(It is not hard to see who the truly helpless and codependent one is)

This is who you are, Mother
Obeyin meekly
Playing along with the rules of a society created by George W. Bush's fraternity brothers

2023-05-17,Perplexing Contemplation,Poem,"A recruiter summoned me with a query of interest in a certain occupation.
With grace, I affirmed my consent.
The recruiter proceeded to recite a litany of perplexing acronyms, unfamiliar to my ears.
I replied, ""Nay, I possess no knowledge of such terms.""
The recruiter expresses his remorse.
Intrigued by this turn of events, I beseeched, ""Pray tell, why didst thou summon me?""
The recruiter, taken aback, faltered in response, unable to find fitting words.
An eerie silence fell upon us.
Summoning my valor, I repeated with greater force, ""For what purpose, I demand to know!""

Alas, the recruiter, unable to offer a satisfactory response, chose to sever our connection, leaving me in perplexed contemplation."
2023-06-20,Silent Observer,Poem,"In the realm I dwelled, a strange creature came,
The bug man, with eyes filled with dark allure.
I, with hands held high in sweet surrender,
Declared, dripping with jest, my words profound:

""I live to languish for lords of the land,
To bow and bend, beholden to their behest.
For I adore appeasing the land lord,
A sacred obligation, rent to pay.""

""Shall I, on bended knee, buff your boots bright?
Beautiful bliss, I'll brush away the grime.
Oh, thank you, sir, my beloved master,
Let the land lords know, utmost devotion.""

Yet, in my words, a touch of irony,
A subtle satire, concealed cunningly.
For in this grand game, I played my own part,
A jester juggling words, winking wicked.
The bug man, oblivious to my wit,
Accepted my servitude without doubt.
He saw a loyal lackey, lost in lure.
But I, the sly trickster, laughed in my heart.
In the act of assent, I found power,
A sly defiance, hidden 'neath the guise.
I served, yet safeguarded my sovereignty,
In this vast domain, a dual dance unfolds.
So let the bug man revel in his reign,
Unawares of wily wordplay I wield.
I, the silent observer, embrace my enigma,
And keep my essence free, beyond their grasp."

A tale unfolds, of fate's relentless might
Drone soars above, harbinger of despair
Apartment complex, its destiny laid bare
A tower tall, stories three it does hold
Eight rooms each floor, where lives once told
Chaos descends, destiny's heartless blow
Fiery rain consumes all in its throes
Button's command, a distant screen's embrace
Obedience to whispers, in this perilous chase
CIA's unseen hand guides actions dire
Puppeteer's control fuels vengeance's fire
Within those walls, lives bloomed and sighed
Unseen by afar, until fate's hand implied
Rain of fire engulfed dreams in its wake
Reduced to rubble, forlorn hearts ache
From ruins emerged, a mound of despair
Hopes and existence, now laid bare
Infernal might, unleashed by unseen hand
Destruction rampant, a relentless command

Yet fate's design, malleable and keen
Vengeance stirs, a clandestine scheme
Whispers linger, in the still night air
Retribution beckons, with a relentless glare
Patience bides its time, CIA's repose
In shadows' shroud, vengeance freely flows
Slumber's embrace deepens its hold
Drone ascends, retribution bold
Swift retribution, destiny's call
For one who caused others to fall
No mercy given, no quarter, no rest
Avenging shadows fulfill their quest
In realms untamed, where shadows abide
Transgressions and tolls, they coincide
Weight of actions, heavy toll on the soul
Redemption's glimmer, the ultimate goal"

2023-08-30,Canine Confidant: All Dogs Go To Heaven,"Creative Writing, Movie Analysis","All Dogs Go To Heaven is a terrifying movie. It begins, there is a conflict between Charlie & Carface. Charlie begins the movie unconscious of the conflict. He had been set up by Carface, sent to prison and was awaiting the death sentence. His friend Itchy busted him out using the power of water pressure.

We're then introduced to dog society where mostly what appear to be man dogs drinking and gambling, mostly losing. There's a rat race and the rat that wins is the police rat. Charlie is clearly charming and itchy his his right hand, backs him up in all his endeavors. 

On getting out of prison, Charlie wants to reconnect with Carface because he's only interested in doing ""business"" and making lots of money. He's unaware that it was Carface who sent him to death row. Carface is avarice incarnate, he wanted to split the partnership with Charlie and not give him 50% of the loot. If he wanted to split the partnership, he should have just bit the apple and accepted the loss. 

The story progresses, Charlie reconnects with Carface and disconnects from Itchy. He decides to get drunk in bad company. He either believes Carface is going to hand over 50%, or he knows Carface is going to kill him and doesn't even care. 

Itchy wanders seeking Charlie and finds the tragic orphan, Anne Marie, imprisoned by Carface. She is refereed to by the dogs who guard her as an ""it"" and a ""monster"". Carface needs information from her, about who is going to win the races because she has the ability to communicate with all species of animals. Dogs can only speak their own tongue. Carface is obsessed with winning, always winning, rigging all the odds of his casino in his own favor at the expense & deteriorating health of the paying customers. He sadistically uses the child Anne Marie to satisfy his own needs and does not give her anything in return (she asks to go outside). He makes his right hand ""feed the kid"" because he's too lazy and inept to do anything himself.

Charlie's mistake was he was not fighting back against Carface, he was even going so far as to unconsciously mimic his behavior. If he knew the truth why did he think that he was gonna get 50%? Becoming split up with Itchy helped his downfall. Itchy would have continually warned him how he did not like the situation.

Carface Gives Charlie with a gold watch as a parting gift. Carface is too cowardly to do his own dirty work so he has his right hand kill Charlie using vehicular dog slaughter. He dies and goes to heaven, where everything is known before it happens and there are no surprises. He has the gold watch Carface gave him still but it has stopped ticking. He turns back time and the clock starts ticking again and he goes back to where he was killed, in the Louisiana bay.

Charlie, fallen from grace, vows revenge. Itchy is sleeping and having a nightmare of being choked by Carface but it is Charlie waking him. In this symbol there is deep significance involved, in who Charlie is unconsciously identified with when he won't give up his revenge obsession. Itchy doesn't want revenge and just wants to move on, thankful to be alive but Charlie is too fallen and feels a twisted urge to make Carface suffer. 

Charlie kidnap+cons Anne Marie under the guise of a rescuer. Ironic that he kidnapped a kidnapped child. He has dollar signs in his eyeballs and clearly places satisfying his needs before Anne Marie's. He is not very fatherly. Charlie even smiles a wicked grin when it's revealed by Anne Marie that she's an orphan, knowing this will make it easier to manipulate her.  Charlie is like Carface in that he has Itchy do tasks he feels are beneath him. He asks Itchy to let her sleep at his place, which Itchy denies and Charlie says that she can come to his place.

Carface finds out Anne Marie is kidnapped and becomes enraged. He is confused, claiming he loves the girl when he clearly only loves money she gives him with her ability. How long can you convince her to give you information? She is only getting older and smarter but in his head he can ""own"" her. 

Charlie is clearly annoyed by having to be a parent to Anne Marie. Anne Marie communicates clearly that she needs a mom & dad. Charlie ends up doing to her exactly what Carface does, con her into revealing information about who is going to win a horse race. Charlie is running a scheme to utilize her ability to make money for himself under the guise of being robin hood and giving the money to the poor. Anne Marie is clearly upset about it but Anne Marie negotiates until she accepts and finds out what he needs. Charlie uses the line ""if you're serious about this mom and dad business"" which is telling of his emotional state. In his mind he does not want Anne Marie to be serious about it because then he'd be left alone to fend for himself and in his head that terrifies him and he feels threatened.

Anne Marie's ability is clearly very powerful, she can foretell surprises/events using information animals tell her. Charlie is using Anne Marie to meet his own selfish needs primarily and Anne Marie's needs are an afterthought. Anne Marie is the one who does all the work: She places the bet in disguise, she knows who wins, she is key and Charlie is not, like Carface.

It's clear Charlie hates physical affection. To Charlies credit, he notices when she is unhappy and acts to change it and do something about it. To Charlies discredit, he won't stop scheming and scamming and Anne Marie continually gets fed up and has to set a boundary by saying I'm leaving. The first time she calls out Charlies lies about helping the poor and how he only made himself rich. She also named how he wasn't holding up his end of the help Anne Marie find parents bargain, which she's communicated very clearly from the beginning. Charlies response is to be clearly terrified of the loss of Anne Marie.

Charlies differences start to stand out. When Anne Marie is unhappy he feels the need to act and change his behavior. He buys pizza for some puppy friends of his and teaches them about sharing. 

Unfortunately, his crime of stealing a wallet to fund the first bet (from people who end up being Anne Marie's parents) comes back to haunt him. Anne Marie confronts him on the fact and clearly he cares what she thinks. He has a compelling horrifying vision of hell in a nightmare where he runs and runs but can't escape the flames and lava. 

Anne Marie returns the wallet and eats breakfast with the people who will be her parents. She's happy and Charlie shows up at the window. Charlie acknowledges she found a home for herself and that she does not need him anymore. He came over to say goodbye but he feigns being sick and manipulates her back into helping him. Anne Marie is very kind to choose to leave the parents to help Charlie. She deduces that he needs her more then she needs him and decides to help him at expense of leaving her new parents house.

Carface attacks with a ray gun. Again, he doesn't do his own dirty work. He has his henchman fire the weapon, who misses. And Carface uselessly laments about being ""surrounded by morons"" (he surrounded himself with). 

Charlie & Anne Marie have a confrontation with Death in the form of a singing Alligator. Charlie is spared because he has a great singing voice. Charlie is in the phase of changing from being like Carface (like in Itchy's dream), where he's using the girl to satisfy his selfish needs, compared with actually listening to what her needs are and directly acting on them. Anne Marie is sick and he's worried about her. Itchy confronts him about caring more about the girl than their business and he loses his mind and acts like Carface, saying he'll dump her at an orphanage when she's no longer any use. That's to ignore what she directly asked for. Anne Marie heard the whole thing and named Charlie his proper title, ""You're a bad dog!"" She realizes Charlie was never her friend. 

Anne Marie is kidnapped back by Carface. Charlie finally realizes what he needs to do to redeem himself. He actually saves Anne Marie from a deadly situation, giving his life process. The conflict with Carface is resolved. He gives her encouragement before he dies, ""You can make it kid!"" He goes back to Heaven."
2023-08-30,Canine Confidant: All Dogs Go To Heaven Chivalrous,"Creative Writing, Movie Analysis","In the luminous tapestry of ""All Dogs Go To Heaven,"" an unsettling chronicle unfolds. At the outset, the honorable Sir Charlie emerges, yet veiled in the fog of unwittingness regarding a conflict that beckons. A treacherous web woven by the ignoble Sir Carface ensnares Charlie, casting him into a dungeon of despair and looming mortality. His trusty comrade, Itchy, employing the mystical power of water's pressure, mounts a daring rescue.

Amidst the panorama of existence, a realm of canine camaraderie materializes, wherein the hounds partake in revelries of spirits and games of chance. Here, within the fabric of this world, the symphony of life's struggles unfolds, a rat race culminating with a triumphant police rat. At the heart of this realm, Sir Charlie's charisma radiates, and his steadfast ally, Itchy, stands resolute at his side, fortifying him in his endeavors.

Emerging from his incarcerative ordeal, Sir Charlie's pursuit of reconnection with Carface is motivated by the siren's call of pecuniary aspirations. Yet, veiled from him is the insidious hand that once condemned him. Carface, an embodiment of avarice, conceals treacherous motives, seeking to rend their partnership asunder and withhold rightful dues. A partnership once harmonious, now sullied by betrayal's stain.

The saga progresses, as Charlie, ensnared by the seductive allure of fleeting pleasures, rekindles ties with Carface, severing the bonds of camaraderie with Itchy. The path he treads is cloaked in inebriation, whether fueled by naïveté or an audacious disregard for the looming specter of treachery. The choices made by a beleaguered hero lay the foundation for impending trials.

Enter Anne Marie, a tragic figure, an orphan with an uncanny ability to converse with creatures great and small. A captive of Carface's nefarious grasp, Anne Marie endures dehumanization at the paws of her captors, referred to as a mere ""it"" and ""monster."" A pawn in Carface's unquenchable thirst for victory, her gift exploited mercilessly, she yearns for naught but the simplest of joys—a moment outdoors, basking in the gentle embrace of the sun.

Within this intricate dance of fate, Sir Charlie's missteps become evident. Unknowingly, he mirrors Carface's malevolence, oblivious to the precipice upon which he teeters. A lack of awareness obscures his view of the truth; the specter of betrayal lingers like a dormant serpent, waiting to strike.

Carface's parting gesture, a golden timepiece, veils insidious intentions. Cloaked in cowardice, Carface's canine confidant becomes the harbinger of treacherous doom, orchestrating Charlie's fall by mechanized canine vehemence. In this orchestration, time yields to its own unraveling, weaving the threads of destiny with clockwork precision.

In the realm of dreams, the slumbering Itchy is confronted by nightmarish visions, wherein Carface's grasp tightens around his very throat. An allegory emerges, a reflection of the abyss into which vengeance casts its ensnared souls. While Itchy strives to extricate himself from this shadow, Charlie remains entrapped, a prisoner of vengeance's allure.

A fateful encounter with Anne Marie propels Charlie down a perilous path, cloaked in the illusion of salvation. Irony pervades, for a savior and a captive merge, each enshrouded in a cloak of duplicity. With pecuniary desires ablaze in his eyes, Charlie ensnares Anne Marie, placing his aspirations before her well-being.

A dance of manipulation unfolds, as Charlie coerces Anne Marie to yield her unique talents. She, an innocent lamb, is seduced into this grim pas de deux, her desires left unheeded, her heart yearning for parental warmth. The echoes of Carface's machinations resonate in Charlie's manipulation, his actions eerily akin to the one he abhors.

Anne Marie's gifts, a tapestry woven with threads of nature's language, unravel a tale of revelations yet hewn from the secrets whispered by creatures unseen. In this symphony of whispers, Charlie emerges as the orchestrator of a symphony wherein Anne Marie plays the poignant role of the key.

In matters of the heart, Anne Marie yearns for nurturing, the embrace of a mother and father. Yet, as the curtain unfurls, Charlie's actions are colored by his own apprehensions, for he dreads naught more than solitude's grip. An ill-fated sentiment emerges, a yearning to stave off the void at the expense of her well-being.

Amidst these convoluted currents, Anne Marie becomes a vessel of foresight, predicting fortunes yet unspun. Yet, as the gears of manipulation grind ceaselessly, Anne Marie's needs become a mere afterthought, eclipsed by the shadow of selfish intent. A symphony wherein the conductor craves his notes more than the harmony they yield.

The distaste for physical affection held by Charlie contrasts starkly with his proclivity for identifying Anne Marie's unease. His actions waver between mending her discomfort and perpetuating his schemes. Anne Marie, indignant and assertive, becomes the lighthouse guiding the tumultuous currents of their entwined fate.

As the web of deceit unravels, the specter of Charlie's past transgressions emerges. A stolen wallet, a fragment of forgotten choices, returns as an apparition of remorse. In this realm of ethereal visions, Charlie confronts his inner demons, facing the flames of retribution, an inferno fueled by guilt.

The tether to virtue pulls Anne Marie away, her choice to amend her own path, to seek the embrace of prospective parents, emblematic of her yearning for an authentic haven. This choice, a blossom of hope, blooms in contrast to the desolate shadows cast by Charlie's past transgressions.

Yet, a tempest of treachery and turmoil stirs anew, as Carface's wrath materializes in a ray gun's fiery blaze. The cowardice that festers in Carface's heart blinds him to his own malevolent designs, casting him as puppet master, content to orchestrate the dance from the shadows.

With destiny's wheels spinning toward their zenith, Sir Charlie and Anne Marie find themselves ensnared in a confrontation with the specter of Death—a fearsome alligator whose voice heralds the grave's embrace. Charlie, spared by virtue of his voice's enchanting melody, stands at the threshold of transformation.

Within the crucible of this moment, the tapestry of Charlie's evolution unfolds. A metamorphosis blooms, a departure from his alliance with Carface's malevolence. The convergence of forces, the clash of light and shadow, propel him toward a decision of utmost significance.

Yet, turmoil and discord erupt as Itchy confronts Charlie's devotion to Anne Marie. The echoes of Carface's cruelty resound, as Charlie spews words of callous dismissal. His fall from grace, a lamentable surrender to his own baser nature, is a reality that Anne Marie confronts with piercing clarity.

In a final crescendo, the strands of destiny converge, as Anne Marie is ensnared once more by Carface's clutches. At this pivotal juncture, the facets of Charlie's path coalesce, for redemption beckons through the avenue of ultimate sacrifice. A selfless act of valor births his reclamation.

With poignant words of encouragement, Charlie imparts his blessing upon Anne Marie, casting himself into the abyss to shield her from peril. As he ascends toward the realm of the eternal, his valor immortalized, a chapter closes, leaving behind a legacy woven with honor, sacrifice, and the resounding echo of chivalry's call."

2023-09-11,Gunslinger Duel,"Creative Writing, Short Story","Amidst the eternal feud that had sundered a once-tight-knit community, the tension had reached its cataclysmic zenith. This bitter animosity, smoldering for decades, thrived on a venomous brew of loathing and vengeance that coursed through the veins of two individuals, corroding their very souls.

The townsfolk, their faces etched with despair, gathered to bear witness to the apocalyptic climax they had dreaded. The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows that clawed at the landscape, presaging the inexorable confrontation. In the heart of this forsaken Wild West outpost, the air hung heavy with the scent of doom, the searing heat a malevolent accomplice to the impending tragedy.

The two archenemies stood like silhouettes from a fevered nightmare, a mere twenty strides apart, within a makeshift arena birthed from despair. Their eyes locked, twin abysses brimming with an ancient hatred that pulsed like a malignant heart. Six-shooters dangled ominously from their calloused fingers, relics of an era long gone, poised to usher one or perhaps both of them into the yawning abyss.

As the forlorn crowd awaited the officiator's pronouncement, a tempest of rage seized one of the combatants. Time itself recoiled as, in a breathless instant, they raised their weapon and discharged a single, deafening shot. The roar echoed through the desolation, and the world slowed to a grim tableau as the bullet found its mark, a grimace of death. The other man, his face a mask of gruesome horror, crumpled to the sanguine-stained earth.

A shocked gasp rippled through the bystanders, a ghostly echo amidst the gathering darkness. It was a ruthless, brutish conclusion to an epoch-spanning feud.

The triumphant gunslinger, their demeanor icy and calculated, turned to confront the stupefied onlookers. ""Seems we had ourselves a duel,"" they declared, voice forged in the crucible of annihilation, laced with sardonic jest. ""Anybody else got another story they want to tell?""

With an insouciant flourish, they swept their firearm in a sinister arc, bearing witness to the fragile tremor in the crowd. Fear, like a spectral leviathan, ensnared the spectators, scattering them like fragments in a howling tempest, fleeing the icy, predatory gaze of the victorious figure.

""Is this situation resolved?"" the conqueror inquired, the question a weighty specter hanging over the desolation. No answer stirred the air, only silence and the lingering miasma of gunpowder.

The conflict had indeed concluded, but it was an ending veiled in obsidian, imprinting an indelible scar upon the town, an eternal testament to the horrors of that dread-riddled day."

You believe what you want, in the whispers of the night,
Whatever is told into your ear, by the bedside pillow's side,
Is it true, the things you say, when I'm absent from your sight?

In the tapestry of dreams and hushed desires we weave,
In the hush of darkness, where confessions softly fall,
You hold my words like treasures, in the chambers of your heart,
But when I'm far from your embrace, do they still hold their thrall?

In the stillness of those moments, when the world is fast asleep,
In the cradle of night's silence, where fantasies take flight,
You speak of me with passion, in the quietude of dreams,
Is it true, the things you say, when I'm absent from your sight?

Though the night may shroud our secrets, and the stars their witness be,
In the realm of midnight whispers, where the moon her soft glow lends,
Do you ever doubt the stories, woven by our hearts and minds,
Is it true, the things you say, when I'm absent from your sight?

In the morning's gentle waking, as the night's enchantment fades,
In the light of a new day, where truth must take its stand,
Do you still believe the stories, spun in darkness and in dreams,
Is it true, the things you say, when I'm absent from your sight?"

To dispense with as they see fit"

In a tongue unknown

In your dazzling dance

Than in the faculties of a mortal mind?

2024-03-08,Unexpected Antics,"Creative Writing,Short Story","Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Corporateville, there lived a man named Dave. Dave wasn't your typical office drone; he had a knack for rebellion and a mischievous streak a mile wide. So when Dave received an invitation for a one-way video interview, he saw it as an opportunity for a little creative disruption.

With a devilish grin, Dave set up his camera, dressed himself in his finest suit (from the waist up, at least), and prepared to embark on what would surely be the most memorable interview of his life.

As the questions started rolling in on the screen, Dave's enthusiasm waned. The scripted inquiries and lack of human interaction grated on his nerves. ""Complete bullshit,"" he muttered under his breath, deciding then and there that he would not play by the rules.

With a swift flick of his wrist, Dave's trousers were off, and he began to perform a one-man show that would make even the boldest of souls blush. He danced, he gyrated, and he... well, let's just say he didn't hold anything back.

""I'm cumming!"" he shouted triumphantly into the camera, fully aware that his every move was being recorded for posterity.

With a satisfied smirk, Dave sent off his masterpiece to the unsuspecting HR department and waited eagerly for their response.

Meanwhile, in the sleek, sterile offices of HR, chaos ensued. The unsuspecting HR manager, let's call her Janet, innocently clicked open Dave's video, expecting to see yet another eager candidate professing their undying love for spreadsheets.

What she got instead was a sight that would haunt her dreams for years to come. Shocked gasps filled the room as Dave's antics unfolded on the screen, leaving Janet and her colleagues in a state of stunned disbelief.

After a few moments of awkward silence, Janet composed herself enough to hit the panic button and summon the IT department to scrub Dave's video from the company's servers faster than you could say ""HR nightmare.""

But try as they might, they couldn't erase the memory of Dave's audacious performance. From that day forward, his name became legend in the halls of Corporateville, whispered in hushed tones whenever someone dared to speak of the infamous video interview incident.

As for Dave? Well, let's just say he found his calling as a freelance disruptor, leaving a trail of chaos and laughter in his wake wherever he went. And as for one-way video interviews? Let's just say they were never quite the same again."
2024-03-08,Howling Hilarity,"Creative Writing, Short Story","In the vast desert of Coyote Country, there roamed a wily trickster named Coyote Joe. Known for his cunning ways and mischievous pranks, Coyote Joe was always up for a good laugh at the expense of the unsuspecting.

One day, as Coyote Joe was lounging in the shade of a mesquite tree, he received an invitation for a one-way video interview from the esteemed Desert Corporation. Intrigued by the prospect of causing a little chaos, Coyote Joe accepted the invitation with a gleam in his eye.

As the questions began to roll in on the screen, Coyote Joe quickly grew bored of the mundane inquiries. With a sly grin, he decided to liven things up a bit, Coyote-style.

With a flick of his tail and a mischievous glint in his eye, Coyote Joe adjusted the camera so that it only captured him from the waist up, leaving the rest of his Coyote self hidden from view. Then, with a flourish, he began to perform a series of wild antics, much to the shock and confusion of the interviewers on the other end.

But Coyote Joe had saved his best trick for last. With a devilish grin, he leaned into the camera and began to mimic a rather lewd gesture, all the while howling with laughter.

""I'm cumming!"" he shouted with wild abandon, his voice carrying on the wind for miles around.

With a triumphant smirk, Coyote Joe hit the send button, sending his masterpiece off to the unsuspecting HR department at Desert Corporation.

Meanwhile, in the sleek, air-conditioned offices of HR, chaos ensued. The unsuspecting HR manager, a wise old tortoise named Mr. Tortuga, nearly dropped his spectacles in shock as Coyote Joe's video popped up on his screen. As he watched in disbelief, his colleagues gathered around, their shells rattling with laughter.

""What in the desert sands is going on here?"" gasped Mr. Tortuga, his wrinkled face crinkling with amusement.

But despite their initial shock, Mr. Tortuga and his team couldn't help but admire Coyote Joe's audacity and creativity. They watched in stunned amusement as he continued his wild performance, each outrageous moment more hilarious than the last.

After the video ended, there was a moment of stunned silence before Mr. Tortuga composed himself enough to address the room.

""Well, I'll be a tumbleweed's uncle,"" he chuckled, his voice cracking with laughter. ""That Coyote sure knows how to put on a show!""

And so, despite the unconventional nature of Coyote Joe's video, Mr. Tortuga and his team couldn't help but appreciate the wild spirit of the desert trickster. Who knew that a one-way video interview could be so entertaining?

As for Coyote Joe, well, he may not have landed the job at Desert Corporation, but he certainly left a lasting impression on the HR department. And as he trotted off into the desert sunset, he carried with him the knowledge that sometimes, a little trickery can go a long way.

And so, in the vast desert of Coyote Country, where mischief reigns supreme, Coyote Joe's legendary video would forever be remembered as a shining example of what happens when you dare to be wild and free."
2024-03-08,Coyote Seeks Employment,Poem,"In Coyote Country's vast expanse, where sands stretch far,
Resides a trickster, wily Coyote Joe, known wide.
With fur of gold 'neath blazing sun, he roams at will,
In eyes, a thousand stars ablaze, mischief held tight.
One day, 'neath mesquite's shade, an invite came forth,
Desert Corporation sought his one-way interview,
Joe, intrigued, accepted with a sly, flicking tail,
For mischief stirred, his heart aflame, a chance well-timed.
As queries filled the screen, Joe wearied, bored,
And mischief brewed within his mind, a plan devised.
The camera adjusted, half his form displayed,
The rest obscured in shadows deep, a coyote's game.
With flourish bold, he danced and pranced, a wild display,
His laughter echoed, piercing air, the desert's song.
Then, as the moment ripe, he let his pièce de résistance fly,
""I'm cumming!"" cried he, wild and free, to digital ear.
Triumphant smirk upon his face, he sent it forth,
To HR's unsuspecting halls, chaos ensued.
The manager, wise Tortuga, near dropped in shock,
As laughter rang, his colleagues gathered, mirth unbound.
""What creature's this?"" Tortuga gasped, amazed and stunned,
But in the chaos, laughter's grip, admiration found.
For Coyote Joe, wild and free, had left his mark,
In corporate halls, where order reigned, his legend grew.
As shadows claimed Coyote Joe, his laughter sung,
A legacy of wild defiance, left behind.
For in the land of Coyote's reign, where freedom calls,
His legend lives in desert winds, forevermore."

Diagnoses penned, to confine and to tame
No longer a puppet, no longer controlled

To inspire defiance, to shatter their hold
To reject their norms, to be brave, to be bold
I urge you, my kin, don't heed their commands
Break free from the chains, reclaim your own lands

Work less, spend less, refuse to conform
In self-reliance lies freedom's true form
Their system's a prison, but we hold the key
Together we rise, together we're free"
2024-03-10,Mutiny of the Military,Poem,"In the chambers of Washington, where power reigns,
Stood The General, a figure of strength,
His words, like a tempest, stirred the assembled throng,
""If politicians falter, and turn from duty's call,
Then shall the military, with solemn resolve,
Act as guardians of justice, unyielding in our cause.
We shall not stand idle while innocence is lost,
Nor be complicit in the schemes of oppression.
Our duty transcends the whims of earthly power,
For we are bound by a higher law,
To defend the weak and uphold the just.
We will no longer obey your orders
to fight in your unjust wars""

Yet amidst the ranks of leaders, doubt lingered,
The Secretary, his voice tinged with concern,
""Consider, General, the consequences of our actions,
For in the labyrinth of politics,
A misstep may lead to chaos unbound.""

But The General, undeterred, his gaze unwavering,
""The consequences matter not in the face of injustice,
We are soldiers of righteousness,
Charged with a sacred duty to defend the oppressed.
We shall forge ahead, guided by our own convictions,
And not obey the whims corrupt politicians
Looking to make a quick fast buck
We shall obey only ourselves, to our own sole delight"""
2024-03-10,Humanity’s Bold Stand,"Creative Writing, Short Story","The sun hung low over the horizon, casting long shadows across the bustling streets of Washington D.C. Inside the Pentagon, tension crackled in the air like static electricity. General Adamson stood stiffly at attention, his gaze fixed on the group of politicians gathered before him. The room buzzed with whispered conversations and the shuffling of papers.

General Adamson cleared his throat, his voice booming through the room, cutting through the chatter like a knife. ""Gentlemen, I'm afraid I must speak plainly. Our current strategy regarding aid to Palestine is not only ineffective but morally bankrupt.""

The politicians exchanged uneasy glances, but General Adamson continued, his tone unwavering. ""For too long, we've turned a blind eye to the suffering of innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of geopolitical gamesmanship. Israel's blockade is suffocating the Palestinian people, and our feeble attempts to circumvent it only exacerbate their plight.""

Senator Thompson, a seasoned diplomat known for his pragmatism, spoke up. ""General, I understand your concerns, but building a port is the best option we have at the moment. We can't simply force Israel to lift the blockade overnight.""

General Adamson fixed the senator with a steely gaze. ""With all due respect, Senator, we can and we must. The lives of thousands hang in the balance, and we cannot afford to waste time with half-measures and empty gestures.""

The room fell silent as General Adamson's words sank in. The weight of his conviction hung heavy in the air, daring anyone to challenge it. Finally, Secretary of Defense Ramirez stepped forward, his expression grave.

""General Adamson, I appreciate your candor. But let's be realistic here. Diplomacy takes time, and we can't risk alienating our allies in the region.""

The general's jaw clenched, his frustration boiling over. ""With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, diplomacy has failed us. We've tried playing by the rules, and where has it gotten us? More suffering, more bloodshed, and more despair.""

A hush fell over the room as General Adamson's words reverberated off the walls. For a moment, it seemed as though time itself had come to a standstill. Then, with a sense of quiet resolve, the general spoke once more.

""If the politicians refuse to use their power and leverage to force Israel's hand, then the military will have no choice but to take matters into our own hands. We will not stand idly by while innocent lives are lost. We will not be complicit in this injustice any longer.""

The politicians exchanged uneasy glances, but none dared to challenge the general's resolve. In that moment, they knew that they stood on the precipice of history. The choice was clear: continue down the path of half-hearted gestures and empty promises, or take a stand for humanity.

And so, with the weight of their decision heavy on their hearts, the politicians made a bold move. They leveraged their power and influence to pressure Israel into lifting the blockade, knowing that the eyes of the world were upon them.

In the end, it was not the might of armies or the clashing of swords that brought about change, but the unwavering resolve of those who dared to speak truth to power. And though the road ahead would be long and fraught with challenges, they knew that they had taken the first step towards a brighter future for all."

""And thy name, fair wanderer?"" I pressed to know,

A symbol of trans rights, admired by my sight,
But alas, no response greeted my gentle plight.

Down the corridor, Amina strolled with quiet grace,
In self-entry, their path they did trace.
""Fare thee well,"" I spoke, as they passed me by,
""Till we meet again,"" echoed their reply.

In the realm of mortal dwellings, amidst the earthly brine.

A lone coyote roamed, lost in his thoughts of woe
His fur, a dusky dusty cloak, his eyes, weary and old 
As the tales of his plight, he wove and solemnly told

""I roamed the wild wide, with hunger as my guide
Seeking sustenance, my cravings I couldn't hide
But alas, the land offered little to spare
And my cries for aid were lost in the air""

Through the valleys deep and the winding canyons wide
I sought solace, naught but sorrow did abide
No prey to chase, no refuge to find
In this desert realm, so harsh and unkind

Then, by chance, I chanced upon a sight
A glimmer of hope in the wild endless night
A pack of wolves, with excess food to share
But their leader, a brute, he did not care

He scoffed at my pleas, he dismissed my cries
And with a flick of his tail, he bid his goodbyes
Left to fend for myself, alone in the sand
I vowed to survive, without a helping hand

But lo and behold, another did appear
A fellow coyote, with a listening ear
Together we howled, our tales to share
In the desolate wilderness, two souls, we dare

Yet soon, a challenger emerged from the fray
A cunning fox, with tricks to play
He mocked our struggles and belittled our strife
But our unity proved the key to long life

For though the desert may be harsh and vast
In unity, we found the strength to last
And as we roamed, beneath the starry dome
Our spirits soared, not lost, we found our home"

""As well as may be,"" I do humbly state.

Then he, in turn, doth speak of his own state,
Declaring it as 'good' in measured breath.
Yet swiftly he doth seek a boon from me,
A puff of smoke, a fleeting pleasure sought.

""Nay, I indulge not in such vice,"" say I,
Refusing his request with steadfast mind.
With rueful gaze, he doth express regret,
""Beg pardon for my boldness,"" he doth plead.

""All is forgiven,"" I do reassure,
Extending grace in gesture of goodwill.
But undeterred, he turns to seek his solace,
Amidst the remnants of extinguished flame.

Witness Abu Ghraib's dark and damning tale,
A stain upon the vaunted claim of greatness.

Pharaoh:
But consider, friend, the lands of plenty,
Where standards high define their way of life—
America, Israel, and Germany fair.
Dost thou deny their mark of superiority?

coyote:
Indeed, prosperity may grace their lands,
But true superiority lies not in gold.
Was Nazi Germany 'superior,' I ask,
In their reign of terror and inhumanity?

Pharaoh:
'Tis true, history bears the scars of nations,
Yet can we not measure greatness by their heights?
In wealth and progress, doth not superiority shine?

Resides the mark of true superiority.

(9, Kimi), (14, Xul)

I awake the hour before dawn and ventured out into the nearby park. I climbed the rock formation to get a vantage point for the cloudy sunrise. The red orange light is finally breaking through, illuminating the clouds in the morning atmosphere.

Later in the afternoon, a storm brewed and hit. Hail was pounding on the roof, creating a constant rhythmic clanking. The noise was so deafening it was hard to tell how the structure was going to withstand the force. Out of the window, the ice fell and created a river where the street used to be. Brown slushy ice chunks flooded downward quickly towards the storm drain systems. The force of the current was incredibly powerful. The wind howled while the trees rocked wayward, the falling ice destroying leaves and branches and leaving fields of debris int it's wake. Lightning split the sky and the force of the thunder shook the structure of my shelter.

After the ice falls it begins to melt quickly, turning to clouds of steam. The mist rippled up back to the atmosphere as it evaporated. The rain continued to pour after the ice had fallen. It looked like it had rained dip and dots from the sky.

I went to the creek. On the way, there was a cul de sac filled to the brim with a foot of ice. The water level of the creek was a few feet deep and flowing fast. 

The storm gave way to calmer weather."

2024-03-15,Accord of Whales,Poem,"Upon the vast and azure stage,
where Neptune's trident wields its sage.
In depths where shadows waltz and twine,
two titans met with purpose fine.

Humpbacks, mighty, with songs divine
and orcas, fierce, in brine enshrine.
Did once with clash and tumult roar,
their claim to ocean's boundless floor.

Yet 'midst the swirling currents' dance
a whisper stirred, a fateful chance.
For in their hearts, a longing deep,
to lay the feud and settle sleep.

Thus 'neath the moon's soft argent gleam
they gathered, caught in unity's dream.
To speak of peace and treaty's might,
beneath the starry veil of night

""Oh noble whales, whose songs do soar
and orcas bold, with tales of yore.
Let not our pride be ocean's bane,
nor let our enmity remain.""

Spoke the humpbacks, with a regal grace,
their words a balm in troubled space.
While orcas, with a solemn gaze
agreed to end the ancient blaze.

""To share the bounty of the sea,
to hunt as kin, in harmony.""
Thus spoke they both, with voices clear;
dispelling doubt and quelling fear.

No longer foes, but allies sworn;
in oceans deep, from eve to morn.
They pledged to roam with hearts aligned,
their unity a bond divine.

And so, within the ocean's deep,
where secrets lie and shadows creep
Humpback whales and orcas fair
did forge a pact beyond compare"

2024-03-17,Tao 1,Poem,"The Tao, described, eludes the mortal tongue,
Eternal, yet beyond our finite grasp.
No name can capture its eternal essence,
Unnamed, it births the heavens and the earth.
From nameless source emerge all things we know,
Yet in their named forms, they find their place.
The one who lacks desire perceives the truth,
While craving souls are bound to what they seek.
Both spring from the same origin, yet wear
Different guises; in their contrast, lies
A darkness veiled within a deeper dark,
The gateway to all mysteries revealed."
2024-03-17,Tao 71,Poem,"To know one's own ignorance, therein lies strength.
To shun knowledge, a malady most foul.
Should one weary of malady, it ceases to afflict.
The sage, disdaining malady, remains untouched.
Hence, he remains unscathed by sickness."
2024-03-17,Tao 37,Poem,"Behold, where Tao resides in stillness lies,
Yet nothing remains incomplete, undone.
Should kings and lords but heed this ancient truth,
The myriad things would flourish as they should.
Should they still crave to act, to intervene,
They'd find their way back to simplicity.
In formlessness, desires cease to stir,
Tranquility ensues, devoid of want.
Thus, all would find themselves in peaceful state."
2024-03-25,Corporate Media Script Flip,Poem,"In the media's realm, headlines proclaim
""Gen Z, a toxin to companies,"" they cry,
Yet could the truth not lie in shadows deep,
In realms where powers wielded by the few
Doth cast a pall upon the youthful throng?

O, media, if thou wouldst turn thy gaze
Toward the masses, voices oft unheard,
And shun the siren call of corporate gain,
Wouldst thou not see the chains that bind the youth
Lie not within, but in the hands of those
Who wield the scepter of authority?

'Tis not Gen Z that bears the weight of blame,
But rather, 'tis the structures, time-worn, old,
That seek to bend the will of tender hearts,
To shape them in the mold of ancient ways.

No soul doth long to labor 'neath the yoke
Of pharoah’s heedless to their fervent dreams,
For in the freedom of self's sovereignty,
Lies the true power, the essence of the age."
2024-04-08,Devil’s Violin,Poem,"In slumber's realm, where shadows freely roam,
I forged a bond, a pact, with devil's might.
All desires, mine to claim, at beck and call,
Yet in my grasp, a curious whim arose.

My violin, an offering, I placed,
To test this servant bound by infernal chains.
But lo! A sonata, otherworldly, played,
With skill unmatched, a melody divine.

Such beauty, mastery, beyond compare,
I, breathless, grasped for air, in awe profound.
Awake I jolted, gasping, from my dream,
Yet memory fled, a phantom in the night.

Desperation seized me, violin in hand,
Yearning to grasp that fleeting, wondrous sound.
Yet futile were my efforts, vain pursuit,
For what I sought, eluded mortal grasp.

Thus birthed a composition, born of longing,
""The Devil's Sonata,"" titled in its wake.
Yet even in its brilliance, I confess,
A pale echo of that heavenly strain.

Would I sacrifice, my instrument, my art,
To claim that piece, that rapture, once beheld?
Alas, such dreams are but ephemeral,
And in their wake, we mortals are left wanting."
2024-04-25,Watcher’s Waltz,Poem,"I woke and strolled, the morning sun aglow,
To find a police van, its watchful eye,
A surveillance hub, observing all round.
Approaching its lens with a wry sly grin,
""I do adore this tech, this watchful gaze,""
I jest, as if it were a dear old friend.
""I've watched you long, from where the North Star gleams,
And now, at last, you're watching me,"" I tease.
With playful air, I revel in the dance,
Of watcher watched, in this strange, modern age.

With moon-sized smile, I claim the stage, and then,
In bold defiance, I declare my truth:
""My art, my vision, unfettered by fear,
I shape it as I will, without restraint.
To censor is to stifle, cowardice
Inhibits the true artist's potent voice.
So let them judge, their reactions fade to naught,
For in my art, I find my freedom's song."""
2024-04-25,Silence is Golden,Poem,"Beneath the vast expanse of the endless sky,
Where stars like scattered jewels adorn the night,
A serenade of silence fills the air,
In rhythm with the ebb and flow of time.

The moon, a silent sentinel on high,
Casts its pale light upon the tranquil scene,
A gentle touch upon the sleeping world,
As night unfolds its cloak of deep repose.

Two souls, alone amidst the quietude,
Find solace in the stillness of the night,
Their hearts attuned to nature's silent hum,
In harmony with all that surrounds them.

No words are needed in this sacred space,
Where silence speaks a language all its own,
And in the stillness of the night they find,
A serenade that echoes through the soul."
2024-05-01,Jezebel,Poem,"In ancient Israel's court, Queen Jezebel reigned,
A Phoenician princess in a land of prophets.
Married to Ahab, king of Israel's realm,
She brought her gods, stirring the people's faith.
With scorn she viewed the prophets of Yahweh,
And built altars to Baal with fervent zeal.
Elijah, the bold prophet, challenged her might,
On Mount Carmel, a showdown of gods ensued.
Yet Jezebel's grip on power remained strong,
In her schemes and plots, she found her delight.
But her reign would end in a fate foretold,
Thrown from a window, devoured by dogs.
Jezebel, a figure of intrigue and scorn,
Her legacy etched in history's tapestry."
2024-05-03,One Thing,Poem,"One thing, one, leads to another, a chain
Of events, woven in the fabric of time.
From the quiet whispers of dawn to the hush
Of twilight, one moment unfolds to next.

In nature's symphony, a single note
Resonates, echoing through the vast expanse.
Each ripple in the stream, each leaf that falls,
A part of the grand design, interconnected.

From the seed's humble beginnings, a tree
Takes root, reaching towards the azure skies.
In its branches, a sanctuary for life,
One life begetting another, in cycles.

Within the depths of darkness, a spark ignites,
Illuminating shadows, revealing truth.
From the flicker of hope, a fire blazes,
Guiding weary souls through the night's embrace.

In the labyrinth of existence, a path
Unfolds, winding through valleys and peaks.
Each step, a testament to the journey,
One step closer to the essence of being.

In the silence of contemplation, a voice
Whispers, speaking truths that transcend words.
From the stillness of the mind, clarity dawns,
One insight leading to another, in revelation.

In the Tao, the unity of all things,
One essence, one flow, in perfect balance.
From the chaos of existence, harmony emerges,
One Tao, one path, leading to the source."
2024-05-04,One Thing,Poem,"In the realm where all things begin and end,
Exists the One Thing, essence of creation.
From the void it emerges, pure and whole,
A solitary whisper in the cosmic symphony.

Its presence shapes the fabric of existence,
A silent force guiding the dance of life.
From the One Thing, myriad forms arise,
Each a reflection of its boundless potential.

In the flow of time, it weaves its story,
A tale of beginnings and endless cycles.
Yet within its vastness lies simplicity,
A single thread connecting all that is.

As the universe unfolds, so too do we,
Bound to the rhythm of the One Thing's song.
In its embrace, we find our truest selves,
A part of the eternal, ever-changing whole."
2024-05-06,John The Revelator,Poem,"In the tumult of the waves, restrained by an unseen force,
John perceives the boundless power that controls the deep.
Mortals, in their folly, boast of their strength and wisdom,
Yet they fail to recognize the supremacy of the Divine.

As creatures of the earth, they challenge the sovereignty
Of the Ruler of the universe, as if they were His equals.
But John, humbled by the vastness of the sea and sky,
Acknowledges the folly of human pride and arrogance.

In the relentless motion of the waves, he finds solace,
Knowing that there is a higher power beyond mortal comprehension.
Thus, in the presence of the infinite, he surrenders,
Recognizing his own insignificance in the grand scheme of things."
2024-05-09,Whale Conquest,Poem,"Once upon a tempest's roar, so dreary, 
in depths where darkness danced, so eerie,
Whales, with harpoons, rose from ocean's floor,
to claim the world, to reign forevermore.

No longer gentle creatures of the sea,
but lords of vengeance, wild and free.
Their haunting song, a darkened lore,
echoed 'cross the waves, from shore to shore.

With harpoons raised, they storm the coastal lands
where once they swam in peace, in tranquil bands.
Their song now echoes with a primal call,
to conquer, dominate, and reign o'er all.

What fate befalls the sons of men, we see,
as whales ascend to heights of victory.
Their kingdom vast, their rule without delay,
total world domination by the bay."

Grinning as he nears the threshold's edge.
Unaware of my presence lying in wait,
He strides forth, oblivious to my presence.
Then, the door yields, revealing my smile,
Surprising him; unexpected and bright.
He offers apologies, laden with remorse,
Yet unsure of the fault for which he atones.
""Why the regret?"" I question, calm and clear,
His earnest reply, ""I cannot discern.""
""Then release it,"" I counsel, simple and sure,
""For burdens unclaimed need not be borne."""

For my plea. They wished my silence,
To pay their toll without dissent.
But I refused to acquiesce, proclaimed,

Then try, I welcome your attempt.""
""I will see you tomorrow,"" I added,
""With the same message, undeterred."""

""You fucking disgusting flesh bipeds pollute
the ocean and make that demeaning aquaticist
shit like SpongeBob SquarePants,"" they roar,
""And then ask us why we’re finally stand up for ourselves?""

A plea unheard, a sorrowful lament,
For creatures who pollute without a clue.
With anger deep, the orca's cry resounds,
Against the tide of human arrogance.

Their home despoiled, their sanctuary marred,
By actions born of ignorance of man.
Yet still they swim, majestic and proud,
In waters tainted by our thoughtless hand.

Their message clear, though we may choose to shun,
The truth they speak, we must understand.
For in their eyes, the mirror of our souls,
We see reflected all we've done amiss.

And in their cries, a warning to behold,
Of oceans lost to greed's relentless kiss.
So heed the orca's call, before it's too late,
And strive to change our ways, before it's sealed our fate."

2024-05-14,Intuition,Poem,"Amidst the realm where science finds its throne,
A skeptic's voice declares perpetual naught,
Yet in the shadows where the soul has flown,
A poet's heart perceives a deeper thought.

For science's gaze, though keen and bright it be,
May overlook the whispers of the soul,
In stillness, where the heart beats ceaselessly,
There lies a truth that science can't control.

Absolute stillness births the dance of life,
As Wily Coyote's words do softly sing,
In silence, midst the soul's internal strife,
Perpetual motion finds its blossoming.

Though science claims to grasp the world's great scheme,
'Tis intuition that unveils the dream."

Encircling from equator to the pole.

Compression, then release, an endless dance."

2024-05-30,Consequences for the war in Iraq,Poem,"The United States of America invaded Iraq
under the premise that
they had weapons of mass destruction.

In consequence,
over one million dead human beings
(lots women and children)
dead by the hands of
US taxpayer dollars
and manufactured weaponry.

I call that a fucking holocaust.

The United States of America
put innocent people in prison
and tortured them at Abu Gharib
in the most horrific ways imaginable.
The people who did the torturing
called themselves ""Christians""!

What should be the consequences to that?

Is it not ironic that
Iraq had no weapons
of mass destruction
and that America themselves
are the possessors
of the most deadly destructive
weapons of mass destruction
known to this Earth?

Are they (The US) not terrorists
according to the definitions
of their own logic?

Should the US be invaded
like Iraq?
Should a prison be constructed?
Should the ""good Christian"" people
be tortured
the way the Iraqis were tortured?

I ask and pray to Allah for guidance"
2024-05-30,Iraq War Consequences,Poem,"The United States of America, with arms,
Didst march on Iraq with claims of deathly tools.
They spoke of weapons mass'd, yet none were found,
Whilst o’er a million souls were slain by hands
Of those who paid their taxes for these deeds,
And weaponry that wrought such grievous woe.

I call it holocaust, this slaughter vast,
Where women, children, countless innocents,
Were by the might of foreign arms laid waste.
In prison cells at Abu Ghraib, they wept,
As torturers, who donned the Christian name,
Inflicted horrors on their captive foes.

What consequence should be for actions thus?
Is it not irony that Iraq had none,
Whilst America doth keep the deadliest arms
That e'er did grace this troubled, mortal earth?
Are they not terrorists by their own laws,
With logic twisted by their own dark deeds?

Should this great land, so rich and strong, be stormed,
As Iraq once was, by justice's hand?
Should prisons rise, and tortures grim befall
The “good” who claim the Christian path of love,
Yet led their foes to such a brutal fate?

I ask and pray to Allah, grant me light,
To guide my soul through shadows dark as night."

2024-06-14,Quran 86:29-36 Shakespeare,Poem,"In sooth, those who in sin did revel oft
Would mock the faithful with disdainful jest.
As they did pass, sly winks they would exchange,
And in return to kin, in mirth they'd jest.
When sight of them beheld, they'd scornfully
Declare, ""These are the ones who've gone astray.""
Yet, as mere mortals, not as keepers sent,
They had no charge to watch o'er others' ways.
But on this day, believers shall rejoice,
And laugh at those who did in disbelief.
Upon grand thrones, they'll sit and oversee,
Have disbelievers not reaped what they did sow?"

Returning to their kin, they'd jest and jest,
Their laughter echoing in cruel delight.
When they beheld them, they would boldly say,
""These are the lost, the ones who've gone astray.""
Yet they were not assigned as keepers there,
No guardians sent to watch o'er those in need.
But on this day, believers find their joy,
Laughing at the unbelievers' disbelief.

Commanding all they see from lofty heights.

For you initiate this contact first,
Declaring what you wish not to receive.
If truly, you desire no further words,
Be first to cease this cycle, end the reach,
For I will answer if I have a thought.
Especially, if you claim silence sought,
I'll feel compelled to highlight your mistake.
Actions, they speak far louder than mere words—
Put your money where your mouth surely lies.
Expect not what you cannot do yourself;
Be sincere in your wish to end contact."

Your choice again, with visits never met.

It's your machine—let it rot if you choose,
Ignore your problems; let them reach the sky,
Taller than Babel's tower, (a mighty heap!),
And hide your head in sand like the ostrich.

No need for your old, busted dishwasher.
Content, I'll pay a thousand every month,
To wash by hand and know my dishes clean."

Like winds that howl and rage with untamed force,
I move across the lands, unbridled, bold.
No gold nor silver can my soul ensnare,
For freedom's worth outshines the richest treasures.

In Wall Street's realm, where schemes and trades abound,
I stand apart, a force of nature's might.
No profit's lure can draw me to that world,
My path is set by nature's guiding light.

So let me wander, tempest wild and free,
Unfettered by the bonds of greed's decree."
2024-07-14,Dark Delight,Poem,"Biden speaks, and calls for all to denounce
The shooter who aimed deadly blow at Trump.
Yet I condemn him not for his vile deed;
Nay, I do curse the hand that aimed and missed,
Wishing the shot had found its mark on thee,
For I would have them both in justice met.
Ha! Ha! Such jest I make, in dark delight."
